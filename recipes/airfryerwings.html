    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The air fryer is an appliance that basically takes cooking to another level...an easier and faster method for everything. These Air Fryer Chicken Wings not only take a fraction of the time of baking, but get so crispy you'll think they are fried.
    </p>
    <p>Using the air fryer allows them to get super crispy without actually frying them. Once you try this method, you will never cook wings another way. Serve these with Air Fryer French Fries or Instant Pot Corn on the Cob for the perfect meal!
