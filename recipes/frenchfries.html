    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>32 ounce bag frozen french fries</li>
        <li>oil spray</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using the whole bag, spray some oil in the bag using and oil sprayer, then add salt, seasoning salt, or cajun seasoning for a kick! Pour into air fryer basket. If using a portion of the bag, add them to the air fryer basket and spray with oil and sprinkle salt into the basket on top of the fries.
        </li>
        <li>Close the air fryer basket and set the air fryer to 400 degrees and cook for 8 minutes. Open the basket and shake the fries. Close the air fryer then set for 3 more minutes. <p>*Check doneness at this point, if more time is needed add 1-2 more minutes (various brands will differ in cooking time). I do NOT pre-heat my air fryer, but if you do, you may need to subtract 1-2 minutes from the cooking time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Remove carefully from Air Fryer and serve with your favorite meal and sauce!
        </li>
