This will be a simple recipe website to practice my HTML skills. The first commit was a little bumpy, wasn't sure where to enter the commit message - in the VCS or terminal. 
on Oct 20, I finished my first recipe webpage and used best practices to link to the original website where the reciipe was published to give the author the proper credit. I used _blank and noopener noreferrer attributes to make the page safe from any potential security issues. It was FUN to see everything work. Now, off to commit to Github.
Finished adding a third recipe for french fries. I decided to add a little more complexity by linking the air fry chicken wings recipe to the air fry french fries (as they were on the original website, but instead of linking it to that, I linked my own pages to each other)
